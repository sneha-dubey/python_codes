        "\n",
        "Answer: Enclosing a list comprehension in square bracket creates a new list and it will generate entire list in memory , while enclosing it in parentheses creates a generator object and generator comprehension will generate the list one item at a time, it will be useful when working with large list.

        "\n",
        "Answer: generator function contains at least one 'yield' statement. When generator function is called, it returns a generator object by wich we can access element one at a time.\n",

        "\n",
        "Answer:The purpose of a yield statement is to to define a generator function that can be used to generate a stream of data. Each time the generator's next() method is called. This allows the function to produce a series of values over time, rather than computing them all at once."

        "List comprehension is generally faster than a map call because it returns the result immediately."
